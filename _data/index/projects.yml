- name: VLSI architecture of dual-standard de-blocking filter for HAVC/HEVC
  i18n: jalpc
#  gh_user: sakshi-mishra
#  repo: solar-forecasting-RNN
#  img: /static/assets/img/landing/solar-1.jpg
  desc:  Implemented a dual-standard de-blocking filter architecture, which supports both H.264/AVC and HEVC models

- name: Low Power Wallace Tree Multiplier Using Modified Full Adder
  i18n: jalpc
#  gh_user: sakshi-mishra
#  repo: solar-forecasting-RNN
#  img: /static/assets/img/landing/solar-1.jpg
  desc:  Designed a Wallace Tree Multiplier with modified full adder to achieve low power consumption. The ASIC synthesis results showed an average reduction in power consumption, area, and delay compared to the existing approaches

- name: ASIC Implementation of BIST embedded UART
  i18n: jalpc
#  gh_user: sakshi-mishra
#  repo: solar-forecasting-RNN
#  img: /static/assets/img/landing/solar-1.jpg
  desc:  Designed a BIST embedded UART, which is capable of transmission and reception of data bits with accuracy and speed

- name: HSPICE Based Macro-model of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
  i18n: jalpc
#  gh_user: sakshi-mishra
#  repo: solar-forecasting-RNN
#  img: /static/assets/img/landing/solar-1.jpg
  desc:  HSpice Modeled the characteristics of MTJ sub circuit using HSPICE simulator, which is connected along with an NMOS device to act as a basic 1T-1MTJ memory cell

- name: Design of Low Drop-Out Voltage Regulator with Feed-Forward Ripple Cancellation Technique Cadence Virtuoso Tool
  i18n: jalpc
#  gh_user: sakshi-mishra
#  repo: solar-forecasting-RNN
#  img: /static/assets/img/landing/solar-1.jpg
  desc:  Designed a Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator using feed forward ripple cancellation technique that uses low power and has the capability to reject line regulation and load regulation
